Example of an X gate multiplied by another X gate

0 1 * 0 1
1 0   1 0

calulations are done in order of row and column for output

a b 
c d

First is °|¯  then ¯| then |_ then _|
                                    °
									
So:

a * a then b * c = output a
b * a then b * d = output b
c * a then d * c = output c
c * b then d * d = output d

gives:

1 0
0 1

an I gate
